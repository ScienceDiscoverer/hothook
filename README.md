# hothook

This is very powerful and raw alternative to AutoHotkey/X-Mouse Button Control/Clickermann etc. With the power of raw WINAPI you can track any single or combo key and do absolutely anything, like injecting into the process, executing code inside of it etc (some examples can be found in `main.cpp`).

For now what it does is simply launches `RegEdit` and elevated `CMD` with just a single button! Also fixes GIMP built-in help browser window having small size. But possibilities are truly endless!
